## 5. Quick Start (Fresh Install)

### Step 1: Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
# 1. Clone project
git clone <repository-url>
cd SOAPS

# 2. Install PHP dependencies
composer install

# 3. Install Node.js dependencies
npm install
```

### Step 2: Environment Configuration

```bash
# 4. Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# 5. Generate application key
php artisan key:generate
```

### Step 3: Database Setup (Choose SQLite or MySQL)

**Option A: SQLite (Default - Easiest for Development)**
- No additional setup needed. SQLite database file will be created automatically.

**Option B: MySQL (Recommended for Production)**

1. **Create the database in phpMyAdmin:**
   - Open http://localhost/phpmyadmin (or your MySQL admin tool)
   - Click "New" to create a database
   - Database name: `SOAPS` (or any name you prefer)
   - Click "Create"

2. **Update `.env` file with MySQL settings:**
   ```env
   DB_CONNECTION=mysql
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_DATABASE=SOAPS
   DB_USERNAME=root
   DB_PASSWORD=
   ```

### Step 4: Create Tables and Seed Data

```bash
# 6. Run migrations to create all tables
php artisan migrate

# Or use --seed flag to create tables AND seed with default data
php artisan migrate --seed

# To reset database and re-create tables (clears all data):
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

**Tables created by migrations:**
- `users` - User accounts (students, admins)
- `cache` - Application cache
- `jobs` - Queue jobs
- `new_table_name` - Custom application tables
- Plus other application-specific tables

### Step 5: Final Setup

```bash
# 7. Create storage symlink for file uploads
php artisan storage:link

# 8. Compile assets
npm run build   # production assets
# or: npm run dev  # for development with hot reload

# 9. Start development server
php artisan serve
# Visit: http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### Quick Troubleshooting

**Tables not showing in phpMyAdmin?**
- Make sure `DB_CONNECTION=mysql` in `.env`
- Clear config cache: `php artisan config:clear`
- Re-run migrations: `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`

**Migration errors?**
- Check database exists in MySQL
- Verify DB credentials in `.env`
- Clear all caches: `php artisan optimize:clear`

## 11. Useful Artisan & npm Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed` | Reset database and reseed demo data |
| `php artisan storage:link` | **Important:** expose `storage/app/public` via `public/storage` |
| `php artisan queue:work` | Run queued jobs (if using notifications or async tasks) |
| `php artisan optimize:clear` | Clear config, route, view caches |
| `php artisan config:clear && php artisan cache:clear` |
| `npm run dev` | Watch + hot reload assets |
| `npm run build` | Compile & minify production assets |
| `npm run build:ssr` | Build with server-side rendering support |

### Composer Scripts

- `composer run dev` ⇒ boots Laravel server, queue listener, and Vite concurrently (if configured)
- `composer run setup` ⇒ full install workflow (composer + key + migrate + npm build) (if configured)

---

## 12. Environment Tips

- **File Uploads:** uploaded files live in `storage/app/public`. Missing images usually mean `php artisan storage:link` was skipped.
- **Sessions:** configured via `config/session.php`; adjust timeout/security as needed.
- **Mail & Queues:** set `MAIL_*` + queue driver in `.env` before enabling email alerts or background jobs.
- **Database:** Default uses SQLite for easy setup. Switch to MySQL/MariaDB for production by updating `DB_CONNECTION` and related settings.
- **Logging:** check `storage/logs/laravel.log` when debugging.

```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
```

---

## 16. Maintenance Checklist

- Clear caches after env/config changes:
  ```bash
  php artisan optimize:clear
  ```
- Update dependencies regularly:
  ```bash
  composer update
  npm update
  ```
- Back up `.env` and database before deployment.
- Configure HTTPS and trusted proxies when deploying behind load balancers.
- For production, switch from SQLite to MySQL/MariaDB and configure proper database credentials.
